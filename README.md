# Rust C2 Practice Project

A proof-of-concept Command and Control (C2) server and client implementation in Rust, built for learning async programming and exploring common C2 techniques. This project uses `tokio` for async runtime and focuses on:

- Async/concurrent programming practices
- Client-server communication
- Remote command execution
- Modular and extensible architecture

## Purpose

This is a learning project to:
- Practice async Rust programming
- Understand C2 infrastructure patterns
- Implement secure client-server communications
- Test various C2 techniques in a controlled environment

## Status

ðŸš§ Work in Progress - Educational Project Only

## Tech Stack

- Rust
- Tokio async runtime
- Modern async networking patterns

## Note

This project is intended for educational purposes and internal testing only.
